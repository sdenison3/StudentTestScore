Student Test Score Sort

This Program takes a pre-determined set of students with test scores, finds the best score, and outputs it into another file.

If a teacher knows the structure to input the data, it can help return the good performers in the teacher's class

Probably not particularly useful, but it accomplishes what it sets out to do.
